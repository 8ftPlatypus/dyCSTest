# Dyslexic Character Sheets

A library to generate character sheets for Pathfinder 2nd Edition.

See: https://www.dyslexic-charactersheets.com/.

## This is a work in progress

This library is not ready for production use.

You can follow progress on [the project's Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/dyslexic_charactersheets).

# Install

```bash
$ npm install dyslexic-charactersheets
```

# Usage

The library expects to be given a character's details in the form of a plain JavaScript object (details below)

```javascript
let request = {
  data: {
    class: 'druid'
  }
};

const CharacterSheets = require('dyslexic-charactersheets');
let characterSheet = CharacterSheets.create(request);

characterSheet.render(html => {
  fs.writeFile('file.html', data, err => {});
});
```

# API

## create(...)

Calling the constructor creates an instance of CharacterSheet.

```javascript
const CharacterSheets = require('dyslexic-charactersheets');
let characterSheet = CharacterSheets.create(request);
```

* `create()`
   * `request` \<Object\> - The request object (see below).
   * Returns: \<CharacterSheet\>, a character sheet object.

## render(...)

The `render` method produces a file for the request. It takes a callback which gives you either data to save, or an error.

```javascript
characterSheet.render((data, err) => {
  // ... your code ...
});
```

* `CharacterSheet.render()`
  * `callback` \<Function\>
    * `data` \<String\> - The rendered data (in HTML)
    * `err` \<Error\> - Optional error object

## addAssetsDir(...)

Register a directory with asset files. Do this before calling `create`, and it will refer to this directory when looking for portraits, logos and background images.

```javascript
CharacterSheets.addAssetsDir('./assets');
```

* `addAssetsDir()`
  * `dir` <String> - A directory

## onCreate(...)

A hook that is called when a character is created, before any other actions.

```javascript
CharacterSheets.onCreate(request => {
  // ...
});
```

* `onCreate()`
  * `callback` \<Function\>
    * `request` \<Object\> - The requested character.

Note that you may not modify the request during the callback.

## onCreateElementTree(...)

A hook that is called after the element tree has been processed, but before it's rendered into HTML. Used for debugging the resulting element tree.

```javascript
CharacterSheets.onCreateElementTree((elements, title, request) => {
  // ...
});
```

* `onCreateElementTree()`
  * `callback` \<Function\>
    * `elements` \<Object\> - The element tree
    * `title` \<String\> - The character or party's name
    * `request` \<Object\> - The requested character

Note that you may not modify the element tree during the callback.

## onError(...)

A hook that is called when an error occurs.

```javascript
CharacterSheets.onError((err, request) => {
  // ...
});
```

* `onError()`
  * `callback` \<Function\>
    * `err` \<Error\> - Error object
    * `request` \<Object\> - The requested character

# Request format

The request object describes a character, a party, or various other things you may want the library to produce.

For a detailed description of the format, see [the character sheets schema repo](https://github.com/dyslexic-charactersheets/charactersheets-schema).

## Example character

```json
{
  "version": 0,
  "data": {
    "type": "character",
    "id": "76af3e1",
    "attributes": {
      "game": "pathfinder2",
      "name": "Bob the Destroyer",
      "ancestry": "half-orc",
      "background": "hunter",
      "class": "barbarian",
      "printColor": "#f04312"
    }
  }
}
```

## Example party

```json
{
  "version": 0,
  "data": {
    "type": "party",
    "game": "pathfinder2",
    "attributes": {
      "name": "The Gravy Bunch"
    },
    "relationships": {
      "members": {
        "data": [
          { "type": "character", "id": "76af3e1" },
        ]
      }
    }
  },
  "included": [
    {
      "type": "character",
      "id": "76af3e1",
      "game": "pathfinder2",
      "name": "Bob the Destroyer",
      "ancestry": "half-orc",
      "background": "hunter",
      "class": "barbarian",
      "printColor": "#f04312"
    }
  ]
}
```


# Testing

To test this package, clone the package from [source](https://github.com/dyslexic-charactersheets/lib-charactersheets), then run:

```bash
$ cd lib-charactersheets
$ npm install
$ npm test
```

This will:
 - Compile the sources in `src` to create the files in `lib`
 - Build character sheets from the JSON files in `test/in`
 - Save them into `test/out`


# Contributing

## Adding content

The most likely form of contributions will be adding classes, ancestries, feats etc. This should be done by adding units to `src/units`. Units are written in YAML, and may also contain a stylesheet and asset files.

## Bugs

Please raise issues or pull requests on this project.

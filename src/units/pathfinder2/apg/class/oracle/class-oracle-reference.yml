          _{Your conduit to divine power eschews the traditional channels of prayer
          and servitude—you instead glean divine truths that extend beyond any
          single deity. You understand the great mysteries of the universe embodied in
          overarching concepts that transcend good and evil or chaos and law, whether because you
          perceive the common ground across multiple deities or circumvent their power entirely.
          You explore one of these mysteries and draw upon its power to cast miraculous spells,
          but that power comes with a terrible price: a curse that grows stronger the more you
          draw upon it. Your abilities are a double-edged sword, which you might uphold as an
          instrument of the divine or view as a curse from the gods.}

          foes, or depending on your mystery, you might wade into battle yourself.}

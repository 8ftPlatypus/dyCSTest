          _{Many warriors rely on brute force, weighty armor, or cumbersome weapons.
          For you, battle is a dance where you move among foes with style and grace.
          You dart among combatants with flair and land powerful finishing moves
          with a flick of the wrist and a flash of the blade, all while countering attacks with elegant
          ripostes that keep enemies off balance. Harassing and thwarting your foes lets you charm
          fate and cheat death time and again with aplomb and plenty of flair.}

          moves. You stay nimble, moving into the best position to perform your maneuvers
          while dodging enemy blows and responding with swift ripostes. Depending on your
          swashbuckler’s style, you might dance among your foes; slip past their defenses; or
          beguile, distract, or frighten them.}

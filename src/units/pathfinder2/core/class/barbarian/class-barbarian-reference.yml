          _{Rage consumes you in battle. You delight in wreaking havoc and using powerful
          weapons to carve through your enemies, relying on astonishing durability without
          needing complicated techniques or rigid training. Your rages draw upon a vicious
          instinct, which you might associate with an animal, a spirit, or some part of yourself. To many
          barbarians, brute force is a hammer and every problem looks like a nail, whereas others try to
          hold back the storm of emotions inside them and release their rage only when it matters most.}

          risky currents to reach the hidden switch beneath the water’s surface. If something
          needs breaking, you’re up to the task!}

          _{You didn’t choose to become a spellcaster—you were born one. There’s magic
          in your blood, whether a divinity touched one of your ancestors, a forebear
          communed with a primal creature, or a powerful occult ritual influenced your line.
          Self-reflection and study allow you to refine your inherent magical skills and unlock new, more
          powerful abilities. The power in your blood carries a risk, however, and you constantly face
          the choice of whether you’ll rise to become a master spellcaster or fall into destruction.}

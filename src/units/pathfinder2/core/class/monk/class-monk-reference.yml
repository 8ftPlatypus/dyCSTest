          perfection—honing your body into a flawless instrument and your mind into
          an orderly bastion of wisdom. You’re a fierce combatant renowned for martial
          arts skills and combat stances that grant you unique fighting moves. While the challenge
          of mastering many fighting styles drives you to great heights, you also enjoy meditating
          on philosophical questions and discovering new ways to obtain peace and enlightenment.}

          specialized weapons that you mastered during your monastic training. Stances let

# Using Dyslexic Character Sheets

[Read the API documentation](../api/)

The library is intended to be most used in Node.js, but should be compatible with browsers, Electron and any other place JavaScript runs. These instructions will presume you're using Node.js and NPM; for other platforms and package managers, you may need to make adjustments.

## Install

```sh
npm install dyslexic-charactersheets
```

This will fetch the library into your `node_modules` folder.
